cartography version 1.1 (Release date: 2015-11-18)
==============

Major changes:
* Correction of the proportionnal symbols legends (square, bar, circle, triangle). The previous version was incorrect (size proportionnal to radii and not surfaces).
* Add a gradLinkTypoLayer function to plot a layer of colored and graduated links.

Minor changes:
* choroLayer: small correction to allow to plot variable named "x" or "y".
* vignette: correct the name entry, incorrectly named "SpatialPosition"", to "cartography".
* Update of the figure in the README file.
* Darker, and more visible, south and north arrows.
