cartography version 1.3.1 (Release date: 2016)
==============

Major changes:  

* Introduce getOuterBorders that allows to build borders (as getBorders) between non-contiguous polygons.


Minor changes:  

* SpatialPosition package is back to suggested packages.
* fisher-jenks method replaces jenks in discretization methods.
* Addition of the theme parameter in layoutLayer to set col and coltitle according to a cartographic palette.
* Addition of carto.pal.info() function that gives the list of the cartographic palettes. 
* Addition of two qualitatives color palettes.


cartography version 1.3 (Release date: 2016-06-07)
==============

Major changes:  

* Introduce the smoothLayer function, this function computes smoothed maps of potentials. It uses quickStewart from SpatialPosition package.  
* Most of previously suggested packages are now imported.

Minor changes:    

* Introduce the legend.*.values.order parameter in typoLayer, propSymbolsTypoLayer and gradLinkTypoLayer. This parameter allows to order modalities in the legend and eases the color assignement.   
* Change min value in prop*Layer legends.  
* Suppress zero values in propSymb*Layer.
* getGridLayer is faster.
* getLinkLayer is faster.
* getBorders is faster.




cartography version 1.2 (Release date: 2016-02-11)
==============

Major changes:  

* The OpenStreetMap package used to display OpenStreetMap tiles has been replaced by the rosm package. rosm installation is lighter and easier (no Java dependency).  
* The k parameter is deprecated in propSymbolsLayer, propSymbolsTypoLayer and propSymbolsChoroLayer. The inches parameter is to be used instead. This modification allows to compare proportionnal symbols maps.   

Minor changes:  

* Introduce the getFigDim function that helps to find output figure dimension that fit a Spatial object dimension ratio.  
* The discLayer function now returns a (invisible) SpatialLinesDataFrame of discontinuities.  
* NAs are better managed in choroLayer.  
* The graticule.spdf SpatialLinesDataFrame has been expanded.   
* The size of the title box in layoutLayer is fixed to 1.2 lines height.  



cartography version 1.1 (Release date: 2015-11-18)  
==============

Major changes:  

* Correction of the proportionnal symbols legends (square, bar, circle, triangle). The previous version was incorrect (size proportionnal to radii and not surfaces).  
* Add a gradLinkTypoLayer function to plot a layer of colored and graduated links.  

Minor changes:  

* choroLayer: small correction to allow to plot variable named "x" or "y".  
* vignette: correct the name entry, incorrectly named "SpatialPosition"", to "cartography".  
* Update of the figure in the README file.  
* Darker, and more visible, south and north arrows.
