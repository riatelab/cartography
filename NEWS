cartography version 2.0.0 (Release date: 2017-07-XX)
==============

Breaking changes:

* getBorders, getOuterBorders: an x argument is added in first position, x is added to take sf objects as inputs, if x is used then spdf is not used. spdfid is replaced by id. An sf object (MULTILINESTRING) of borders is returned.

* discLayer: spdf, spdfid1, spdfid2 and dfid are replaced by x (an sf object as outputed by getBorders). 

* getGridLayer: getGridLayer replaces getGridLayer + getGridData, x argument replaces spdf and can take an sf object or an sp object. var is added to enter the name(s) of numeric field(s) to compute into the grid. cellsize refers to the targeted area of the cells. The function returns an sf object

* getLinkLayer: spdf, spdf2, df, spdfid, spdf2id, dfids and dfide arguments are replaced by x, xid, df and dfid. x can be either a Spatial*DataFrame or an sf object. The function returns an sf LINESTRING instead of a SpatialLinesDataFrame.

* propLinkLayer, gradLinkLayer, gradLinkTypoLayer: spdf, df, spdfid, spdfids, spdfide, dfid, dfids and dfide arguments are replaced by x, df, xid and dfid. x must be an sf object (as outputed by getLinkLayer).

* legend* functions have been enhanced to be more customizable. 


Major changes: 

* choroLayer, typoLayer, propSymbolsLayer, propSymbolsChoroLayer, propSymbolsTypoLayer, dotDensityLayer, getTiles, getFigDim, labelLayer, smoothLayer: an x argument is added in first position of all these functions. x is added to take sf objects as inputs, if x is used then spdf, df, spdfid, id are not used.

* layoutLayer: the extent argument can take an sf object.








cartography version 1.4.2 (Release date: 2017-03-29)
==============

Minor changes:

* Addition of 2 discretization methods (thanks to @MBunel): 'em' and 'arith'. The "arith" method is based on a arithmetic progression along the variable values. The "em" method is based on subset defined by the mean of a numeric vector.
* Update the list of the available tiles servers (getTiles). This list is reduced and could be extended again depanding on the rosm package evolution.



cartography version 1.4.1 (Release date: 2016-12-15)
==============

Major changes:  

* Addition of the hexagonal regular grid in getGridLayer.  
* Addition of barscale function to plot a custom scalebar.  
* Addition of north function to plot a custom north (or south) arrow.  

Minor changes:  

* small fix on the msd method (breaks order) in getBreaks function.  
* more precise sources for datasets
* renaming twincities data frame to twincities.df
* small fix for ids in getGridLayer


cartography version 1.4.0 (Release date: 2016-08-25)
==============

Major changes:  

* Introduce getOuterBorders that allows to build borders (as getBorders) between non-contiguous polygons.
* Addition of the theme parameter in layoutLayer to set col and coltitle according to a cartographic palette.
* discretization function become getBreaks. 
* A new discretisation based on mean and standard deviation is added to getBreaks. 
* Addition of colNA parameter in choro* and typo* function to set a color for NA values. 
* k parameter in prop* function is now defunct, using k will stop the function.


Minor changes:  

* As it was a heavy import, SpatialPosition package is back to suggested packages.
* As Jenks and Fisher-Jenks algorithms are based on the same principle and give quite similar results but Fisher-Jenks is much faster, "fisher-jenks" method replaces "jenks" in getBreaks methods.
* In most function, if df is missing then spdf@data is used instead.
* Introduce carto.pal.info() function that gives the list of the cartographic palettes. 
* Addition of two qualitatives color palettes ("pastel.pal"" and "multi.pal").


cartography version 1.3 (Release date: 2016-06-07)
==============

Major changes:  

* Introduce the smoothLayer function, this function computes smoothed maps of potentials. It uses quickStewart from SpatialPosition package.  
* Most of previously suggested packages are now imported.

Minor changes:    

* Introduce the legend.*.values.order parameter in typoLayer, propSymbolsTypoLayer and gradLinkTypoLayer. This parameter allows to order modalities in the legend and eases the color assignement.   
* Change min value in prop*Layer legends.  
* Suppress zero values in propSymb*Layer.
* getGridLayer is faster.
* getLinkLayer is faster.
* getBorders is faster.




cartography version 1.2 (Release date: 2016-02-11)
==============

Major changes:  

* The OpenStreetMap package used to display OpenStreetMap tiles has been replaced by the rosm package. rosm installation is lighter and easier (no Java dependency).  
* The k parameter is deprecated in propSymbolsLayer, propSymbolsTypoLayer and propSymbolsChoroLayer. The inches parameter is to be used instead. This modification allows to compare proportionnal symbols maps.   

Minor changes:  

* Introduce the getFigDim function that helps to find output figure dimension that fit a Spatial object dimension ratio.  
* The discLayer function now returns a (invisible) SpatialLinesDataFrame of discontinuities.  
* NAs are better managed in choroLayer.  
* The graticule.spdf SpatialLinesDataFrame has been expanded.   
* The size of the title box in layoutLayer is fixed to 1.2 lines height.  



cartography version 1.1 (Release date: 2015-11-18)  
==============

Major changes:  

* Correction of the proportionnal symbols legends (square, bar, circle, triangle). The previous version was incorrect (size proportionnal to radii and not surfaces).  
* Add a gradLinkTypoLayer function to plot a layer of colored and graduated links.  

Minor changes:  

* choroLayer: small correction to allow to plot variable named "x" or "y".  
* vignette: correct the name entry, incorrectly named "SpatialPosition"", to "cartography".  
* Update of the figure in the README file.  
* Darker, and more visible, south and north arrows.
